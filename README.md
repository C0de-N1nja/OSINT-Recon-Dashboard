An advanced, full-stack web application designed for comprehensive Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering and analysis. This platform provides a modular suite of tools to enumerate a target's digital footprint, perform deep analysis on discovered profiles, and visualize correlated intelligence in a secure, multi-user environment.

## üåü Core Features

The dashboard is built upon a progressive intelligence-gathering workflow, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

#### `Phase 1 & 2: Footprinting & Deep Scraping`
-   **üåê Username Enumeration:** Scans 20+ high-traffic websites to rapidly identify a target's online presence.
-   **üïµÔ∏è Deep Profile Scraping:** Executes browser-level scraping on key platforms (GitHub, Twitter, Instagram) to extract rich metadata, including bios, follower counts, and associated links.

#### `Phase 3: AI-Powered Intelligence Layer`
-   **üß† NLP Entity Extraction:** A custom-trained **SpaCy** AI model processes scraped text to automatically identify and extract key entities: `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, `LOCATION`.
-   **üîó Entity Enrichment:** Cross-references found entities against an internal knowledge base to add contextual information.
-   **üéØ Smart Google Dorking:** For unverified entities, the system programmatically generates advanced Google search queries to pivot the investigation and uncover new leads.

#### `Phase 4: Advanced Data Vector Analysis`
-   **üì∏ Image Metadata (EXIF) Analysis:** On-demand analysis of profile pictures to extract hidden EXIF data, including GPS coordinates, camera models, and timestamps.
-   **üîÑ Reverse Image Search:** Provides a one-click pivot to **Google Lens** for any scraped image, connecting identities across different platforms.
-   **üîç Domain Intelligence:** Performs on-demand **WHOIS** and **DNS** record lookups on discovered websites, revealing technical infrastructure, mail servers, and domain ownership details.

#### `Phase 5: Correlation & Reporting`
-   **üï∏Ô∏è Interactive Relationship Graph:** Generates a dynamic node graph using **Vis.js** to visually map the connections between the target, their accounts, and all extracted entities.
-   **üìÑ Professional PDF & JSON Reporting:** Exports the complete intelligence report into clean, portable formats. PDF generation is handled by a headless browser (**Puppeteer**) for high-fidelity, print-ready output.

#### `Phase 6 & 7: Automation & Secure Access`
-   **ü§ñ Continuous Monitoring:** Profiles can be "monitored," triggering automated, scheduled re-scans via `node-cron` to track a target's digital footprint over time.
-   **‚è≥ History Tracking:** Automatically detects and logs changes to key data points on monitored profiles, creating a complete timeline of a target's digital evolution.
-   **üö® Pastebin Leak Hunting:** An on-demand module that searches for potential credential or data leaks associated with the target's identifiers.
-   **üîí Full Authentication System:**
    -   Secure user registration and login with password hashing via **bcrypt**.
    -   Third-party authentication using **Google OAuth 2.0**.
    -   Stateless session management with **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** stored in secure, `httpOnly` cookies.
    -   Protected routes ensure that all OSINT capabilities are restricted to authenticated users.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18.x or later)
-   Python (v3.9 or later)
-   MongoDB running locally
-   Google Chrome / Chromium browser installed

### 1. Clone & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git https://github.com/C0de-N1nja/OSINT-Recon-Dashboard.git
cd OSINT-Recon-Dashboard

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Setup Python virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure ChromeDriver
This project requires a `chromedriver` that matches your installed Chrome/Chromium version.
1.  Check your browser version (e.g., `Help > About Google Chrome`).
2.  Download the matching `chromedriver` from the [Chrome for Testing Dashboard](https://googlechromels.github.io/chrome-for-testing/).
3.  Unzip and place the `chromedriver` executable in the `/drivers` directory of this project.

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with the following:
```
# Define the python command for your system (python or python3)
PYTHON_COMMAND=python

# Use long, random strings for secrets
SESSION_SECRET=your_super_long_and_random_session_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_other_super_long_and_random_jwt_secret

# Credentials from your Google Cloud Console project
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
# Start the server (with hot-reloading)
nodemon server.js
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
